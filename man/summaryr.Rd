\title{Generate summary statistics for a data frame}
\usage{
summaryR(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame, or a vector of numeric, character, date etc.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the summary statistics
}
\description{
The function is an extension of the R "summary" function in base package. This function takes a data frame
or a vector as input, and then segregates the data in to several data frames based on the data type
(i.e. numeric, integer, factor, character, date, POSIXct) and then runs statitics for each of the data frames
seperately. The function calculates general descriptive statistics such as total row count, number of NA's,
min, max, mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, 1st Quadrant (25th percentile),
3rd Quadrant (75th percentile), IQR, Possible Outliers. Applicable statistical measures are calculated for
each of the data types in the data frame, and then finally aggregated in to a data frame which is returned
as an output of the function
}
\examples{

## Example with numeric vector
a <- c(1,2,3,6,7,89)
summaryR(a)

## Example with factor / character vector
b <- as.factor(c("Rob", "Lacy", "Rob", "Sekar", "Thomas"))
b <- c("Rob", "Lacy", "Rob", "Prasath", "Chandrasekar")
summaryR(b)

## Example with date vector

x <- c(as.Date("2012-12-01"), as.Date("1996-04-21"),as.Date("1987-03-22"),
as.Date("1995-01-13"),as.Date("1900-08-09"))
summaryR(x)

## Example with data frame

df <- data.frame(Name = c("Rob", "Michelle", "Siva", "Rob", "Prasath"),
Age = c(25,54,12,67,182),
DOB = c(as.Date("1993-12-01"), as.Date("1964-12-01"), as.Date("2006-05-28"),
       NA, as.Date("2000-05-28")),
TestScore = c(72,82.5,NA,79.86,86),
Residence = as.factor(c(NA,NA,NA, "USA", "India")), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

summaryR(df)

## Transposing the summaryR data frame can give better readability when working with large data sets
t(summaryR(df))

## Note that the output from summaryR is compactible with View()

## Example for usage with column in the data set

summaryR(df$TestScore)
